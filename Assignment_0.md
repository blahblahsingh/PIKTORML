### What is the definition of Machine Learning according to Arthur Samuel ?
Popular definition is: __"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"__, But this definition does not exist in the papers written by Arthus Samuel in 1959 or 1967.
The closest statements to the above definition are:
__"A computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program."__

__"Programming computers to learn from experience should eventually eliminate the need for much of this detailed programming effort."__
