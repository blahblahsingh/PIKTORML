## Describe at least 2 real-life examples of supervised/unsupervised learning, clustering, classification problems(explain clearly and elaboratively)
 
### Supervised Learning:
1. People categorizing other people on the basis of the language they speak.
For eg: A person over a certain age gains experience that people who are proficient in Punjabi may come from the region of Punjab and people who are proficient in Kanada may belong to the region of Karnataka.  This is purely from past experiences.
2. Incoming Email filtering(Spam and Inbox)

### Unsupervised Learning:
1. Exploratory Analysis in the field of data science
2. Infant playing with shape-block toys
[Infant playing](https://www.coolbabystuffsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/5065b93e4374.jpg "Infant Playing with Blocks")
The infant segregates the blocks of different shapes by pushing them through the cutouts without actually knowing the name of the shape.

### Clustering:
1. In a library, books are clustered together with respect to the genres or the kind of information they contain
2. Bagging vegetables/fruits at the store. The harder vegetables/fruits are clustered together  at the bottom of the bag and the softer vegetables/fruits are kept on the top
 
### Classification:
1. Classifying astronomical objects like planets, asteroids, comets, stars etc based on data like size, velocity, trajectory, composition etc.
2. Eligibility of applicants by a credit card company. Applications are classified as eligible or rejected based on the applicant's annual income, credit score, existing affiliation with another credit card provider etc.
